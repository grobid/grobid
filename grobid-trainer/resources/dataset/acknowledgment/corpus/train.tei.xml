        <acknowledgment>The equivalence of (I) and (II) is well known.  Divinsky (1973)  has proved the equivalence of (II) and (III) for associative rings. Though in the lecture notes by <fundingAgency>Wiegandt</fundingAgency> (1974)  only associative rings are considered, there the proof of the equivalence of (II) and (III) is based on methods of  Leavitt and <fundingAgency><fundingAgency>Yu-lee Lee</fundingAgency></fundingAgency> (<grantNumber><grantNumber>1969</grantNumber></grantNumber>) , Yu-lee  Lee (1969)  and  Watters (1969)  and it works for alternative rings too. For semigroups with 0 the proofs are analogous to those for associative rings. Finally, the <otherInstitution>equivalence of (I)</otherInstitution>, <fundingAgency>(IV)</fundingAgency> and (V) has been established in this paper. ADDED IN PROOF. For associative rings A. D. Sands has proved the same statement in his paper "Strong upper radicals", <individual>Quart. J. Math.

        <acknowledgment>The notion of the third-sector, with which <individual>Michael Dunford</individual> closes his discussion of Lipietz, is crucial to a truly millennial discourse and practice. It is one that has been central in the approach to urban and social development that we put forward in this journal. Can the third sector release the imagination and the vision to which governments, or their current advisers, seem blind? Can the Dome become an icon of what we can, in the new century, leave behind? Meanwhile, William Gibson's bridge, discussed below by <individual>Richard Skeates</individual>, and the now demolished Kowloon Walled City in Hong Kong, present images for the liberated zones, related movements and sympathetic governments-local, regional and national -of the future.</acknowledgment>

        <acknowledgment>The results in this paper may also be applicable to robustness to source distribution. We considered robustness in the observation channel. However, some of results also apply almost without change to robustness in the input distribution. Ornstein'sd-distance  [18] ,  [13]  is also a meaningful distance when the uncertainty is in the input distribution, but requires the cost function to be specific. Such problems for the specific case of minimum mean square estimation were considered in  [25] . The important general problem merits further research.</acknowledgment>

        <acknowledgment>A100) to the three aforementioned heterodontosaurids (Lycorhinus, Abrictosaurus, Heterodontosaurus) and 37 other ornithischian ingroups in an analysis of 221 characters. Reanalysis of 218 of these characters (3 are uninformative) confirms their result; heterodontosaurids join a basal polytomy at the base of Ornithischia in a strict consensus of the many minimum length trees. Resolution of heterodontosaurid monophyly or relationships among heterodontosaurids was possible only when Echinodon, Lycorhinus and three other poorly known ornithischians (Zephyrosaurus, Talenkauen,  Yandusaurus)  were removed from the analysis  (Fig. 103C ). With these poorly known taxa removed, there are 27 minimum length trees (468 steps) with heterodontosaurid interrelationships resembling that in  Sereno (1986) : "BMNH A100" is more closely related to Heterodontosaurus than Abrictosaurus (Butler et al. 2007: fig. 4, node 4;  Fig.  103C ). In  Sereno (1986)  and the present study, "BMNH A100" is referred to Lycorhinus angustidens, and so the proposed relationships are the same  (Figs 102, 103C) . Pisanosaurus was positioned outside all other ornithischians. The link between "BMNH A100" and Heterodontosaurus, however, is supported by two synapomorphies that have broader distribution among heterodontosaurids. Increase in size of distal premaxillary teeth (Butler et al. 2008: character 114), is present to some degree in both Echinodon  (Fig. 19B)  and Abrictosaurus (Figs 31, 35). "Heterodont dentary dentition" : character 124) is a poorly constructed character that refers in part to the presence of a dentary caniniform tooth in "BMNH A100" and Heterodontosaurus. Echinodon, Lycorhinus and Abrictosaurus were scored as lacking such "heterodonty", although from the information in this study it is clear that Echinodon (Figs 16B, C, 19B)  and Lycorhinus angustidens  (Fig. 3)  clearly have a dentary caniniform tooth and the corresponding dentary crown in Abrictosaurus  (Figs 31, 32)  is not truly primitive in form (i.e., labiolingually compressed, subtriangular).  Zheng et al. (2009)  added Tianyulong to the dataset in , which added one more genus to the heterodontosaurid polytomy. Norman et al. (2011: 59)   also used the dataset in , restricting their reanalysis to "diagnosable heterodontosaurids" and a total of 14 ingroups. Thus they excluded Fruitadens, Lycorhinus, and Tianyulong, leaving three heterodontosaurids in the analysis (Abrictosaurus, "BMNH A100", Heterodontosaurus). Like previous hypotheses  (Sereno 1986; , their resolution positioned "BMNH A100" closer to Heterodontosaurus than Abrictosaurus  (Norman et al. 2011:    fig. 41 ;  Fig. 103E ) on the basis of the weak evidence cited above.  Butler et al. (2010)  added six characters (for a total of 227) and two heterodontosaurids (Tianyulong, Fruitadens) to the previous dataset . They corrected character state scores for Echinodon and ordered a subset of the multistate characters (112, 135, 137, 138, 174). Their reanalysis yielded an unresolved basal</acknowledgment>

        <acknowledgment>And the stately ships go on To their haven under the hill; But O for the touch of a vanish'd hand, And the sound of a voice that is still! Break, break, break At the foot of thy crags, O Sea! But the tender grace of a day that is dead Will never come back to me. Противопоставление, в свою очередь, может быть или «прямым» (МОРЕ и ЗЕМЛЯ, МОРЕ и ЧЕЛОВЕК), или метафорическим, когда противопоставляются две метафорически выраженные «идеи». В стихо-творении Сары Тиздейл "Understanding" «серые морские водоросли» ("grey sea-weed"), символизирующие большинство людей, их бедный внутренний мир противопоставляются золоту и другим сокровищам, лежащим на морском дне.

        <acknowledgment>Author disclosures are available with the text of this letter at www.atsjournals.org. consider. We reported no difference in daily fluid balance in the phase 2 BALTI-1 paper (7) but have no additional unpublished data from BALTI-2 (6) or BALTI-prevention (1) to help shed light on this action. However, we note that when intravenous b 2 -adrenergic agonists were used for tocolysis during pregnancy, they have been associated with reduced sodium, potassium, and water excretion, leading to a reduced hematocrit and intravascular hypervolemia  (8, 9)  and development of maternal pulmonary edema  (10) . Finally, we suggest that, although our BALTI-prevention trial did not reduce the incidence of ARDS, we did demonstrate some findings worthy of future study. We found that inhaled salmeterol resulted in a reduction in systemic inflammation, which resulted in reduced alveolar epithelial barrier dysfunction perioperatively. The magnitude of the effects was not sufficient to prevent postoperative ARDS but did significantly reduce the incidence of reported postoperative pneumonia We suggest, therefore, that salmeterol protected the alveolar epithelium in patients undergoing esophagectomy by reducing inflammatory and epithelial damage during injurious one-lung ventilation. We agree with Snyder and Johnson that combination therapies, targeting different mechanisms implicated in the development of ARDS, are likely to be needed to successfully treat and prevent ARDS. n</acknowledgment>

        <acknowledgment>Step 6: Identification of the locus It is now a simple matter of verification that the conic Z with equation (12) passes through 1(0), I\, h, h an d, like any conic passing through the points of an orthocentric set, is a rectangular hyperbola. This may also be deduced from equation  (12) , by applying the test for a rectangular hyperbola on a conic in areal coordinates, as given, for example in Sommerville  [3] . The polar of X (^7 , j4^, jfj) with respect to E is x + y + z = 0, the line at infinity. X is therefore the centre of £. Since there are no terms in yz, zx, xy in equation  (12) , it follows that the triangle of reference is self-polar with respect £ and hence the circumcircle of ABC passes through X. This circumcircle is also orthogonal to the director circle of £ (Gaskin's theorem). Again I am grateful to the referee for pointing out these last two properties.</acknowledgment>

        <acknowledgment>The embracing of the Internet and associated technologies by academics is inevitable and clearly has many benefits to offer, particularly in relation to the ability to access information and to communicate with colleagues. Nevertheless, as argued in this paper, there are a number of issues associated with the use of this technology of which researchers themselves and those responsible for the encouragement and management of research should be aware. There is currently a great deal of interest, at both a theoretical and a practical Ievel, in the use of the Internet for teaching and leaming. However there is also a strong sense in which the research enterprise underpins the whole notion of a university, whether virtual or otherwise. This aspect should not be neglected in our consideration of the impact of computing and communications technology on tertiary institutions. 8.</acknowledgment>

        <acknowledgment>algorithms: one based on DAB and the other based on RAB. DAB uses tuned feature values, whereas RAB estimates class probabilities, to select features and generate likelihood images. By employing the AdaBoost framework, the proposed algorithms can enhance the independence among selected features and compose high quality likelihood images. Experiment results demonstrated that the proposed algorithm can provide more accurate and reliable tracking results than Liang's algorithm  [6] , and Collins and Liu's algorithm  [5] . Future research issues include the development and implementation of a fast learning algorithm to reduce the processing time for online tracking.</acknowledgment>

        <acknowledgment>Anesthesiologists have difficulty to interpret hemodynamics of patients with ACS. Because of increased abdominal pressure, CVP and pulmonary artery occlusion pressure are falsely elevated and do not show true cardiac preload. The main limitations of OP-CABG are incomplete revascularization and intraoperative hemodynamic instability. Therefore, we suspected intraoperative surgical bleeding and right heart failure but did not consider ACS. We emphasize that all anesthesiologists and surgeons must be aware of ACS during OP-CABG, as this could be a potential complication leading to significant hemodynamic deterioration if not recognized.</acknowledgment>
